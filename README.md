This is a GitHub Pages site built using Jekyll, the powerful and flexible static site generator.

## Files

The following files are included in this repository:

- CNAME: This file adds an entry for GitHub Pages to resolve DNS requests for our site.
- _config.yml: This file sets up a Jekyll theme for our site.
- index.html: This is the main page of our site.
- index.md: This file contains the contents of my CV.

### Getting Started

To get started with the site, simply clone the repository and run jekyll serve in the terminal. This will start a local server that you can use to preview the site.
Building the Site

To build the site, run jekyll build. This will create a new directory called _site containing the compiled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the site. You can then upload these files to GitHub Pages using the gh-pages branch.
Customizing the Site

You can customize the site by modifying the _config.yml file and adding or removing content from the index.html file. The Jekyll theme used by this site is fully responsive and includes support for many features such as navigation, pagination, and more.
CV

My CV can be found in the index.md file. It includes information about my education, experience, skills, and accomplishments.
